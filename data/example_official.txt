First (Partial) Problem

Andrew and Siva sent me files that (almost) make up a complete problem. All the assumptions that look real ARE correct assumptions. I went ahead and made some additions to complete the example (if you are uncertain as to which I added, think about which are obviously added to be incorrect/complicating). Because there are two different idealized model images, you should define these as two potential problems for your program. I am hoping/expecting to see your programs using this example next week. Thanks!

 
First Example	

Real-world Situation

Idealized Model

Assumptions

    Hip acts as a pivot point (no lifting off the bed)
    Incorrect Assumption #1.1
        Valid Reason #1.1.1
        Invalid Reason #1.1.2
        Invalid Reason #1.1.3
    Lower leg remains approximately perpendicular to upper leg
    Incorrect Assumption #1.2
        Invalid Reason #1.2.1
        Invalid Reason #1.2.2
        Invalid Reason #1.2.3
        Valid Reason #1.2.4
    Forces are reasonably approximated using static analysis
    Patient does not slide on the bed
    Complicating Assumption #Who Cares I Am Making All This Up?
        Invalid Reason #x.y.z
        Valid
        Invalid Reason #hashtag
        Invalid Reason #HertzRules!
    Incorrect Assumption that includes a lot of text to make certain you can handle it #1.3
        Valid Reason #ExamplesAreHard
